= amrita -  a html/xhtml template library for Ruby

== Summary

Amrita is a a html/xhtml template library for Ruby. 
It makes html documents from a template and a model data.

Key feature

* The template for amrita is a pure html/xhtml document without no
  special tag like <?...?> or <% .. %>

* The template can be written by designers using almost any HTML
  Editor.

* Need no change on Ruby code to change the view of _dynamic_ part
  (not only static part) of the template

* The model data may be standard Ruby data, Hash, Array, String... or
  an instance of a classes you made.

* The output is controlled by _data_ not by logic. So It's easy to
  write, test, debug code. (Good for eXtreamPrograming)

* HTML template can be compiled into Ruby code before execution
  with a little effort.

Amrita mixes a template and model data up to a html document naturally
matching the +id+ attribute of HTML element to model data.

template:

   <table border="1">                      
     <tr><th>name</th><th>author</th></tr> 
     <tr id="table1">                        
       <td id="name"><td id="author">      
     </tr>                                 
   </table>                                
   
data:

   data = {                                               
      :table1=>[                                          
         { :name=>"Ruby", :author=>"matz" },              
         { :name=>"perl", :author=>"Larry Wall" },        
         { :name=>"python", :author=>"Guido van Rossum" },
      ]                                                   
   }                                                      

template + data = output:
 
  <table>                    
    <tr>                     
    <th>name</th>            
    <th>author</th>          
    </tr>                    
    <tr>                     
    <td>Ruby</td>            
    <td>matz</td>            
    </tr>                    
    <tr>                     
    <td>perl</td>            
    .......

== Credits

* Thanks for many suggestions and contribution of Kaoru Shirai.

* The html parser in amrita/parser.rb is based on work of MoonWolf.

* sample/tour/rexml_doc.xml (sample data for sample/tour/xml3.rb)
  was editted from documentation.xml in rexml archive and
  xml format of docs/index.xml is based on it.

* ams(AmritaScript) is based on the idea and sugestion by Mr.Beyond

== ToDos and plans

* AnyData doesn't work well when it was used with other Hint.
* a compiler that produces code with more speed and less flexibility

  (It's difficult to take an appropriate trade-off and make a good interface)
